  title: Updates on React Router
  keynote: true
  extract: >
    Over the past 4 years, React Router has become one of the most widely used pieces of the React ecosystem. Working
    on React Router was actually how I got my start in React, and it's been incredibly humbling and rewarding to work
    on something that brings so much value to businesses and to the React community. In this talk, I'll cover the
    current state of React Router, as well as discuss several new features and updates we have made so the router is
    ready for React's (async) future!

  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Apollo has given us freedom and happiness when it comes to managing our data coming from
    the server but we still had to write code and sometimes a lot of it to manage our local state?<br> <br>
    Well, what if we managed it with queries too? Sounds too awesome right?<br> <br>
    Let's learn how to do this with apollo-link-state

  keynote: false
  extract: >
    I will talk about how design prototyping and production code are increasingly operable. 
    I will speculate on what the future can hold in terms of merging design prototypes and 
    production code and what we already can do with the tools we have today.

  keynote: false
  extract: >
    This talk is going to focus on some advanced patterns in building your react components.
    More over we do not know what the best way to do things and we end up feeling stressed out.
    To release your stress let talk you can make use of some patterns that worked for us best and
    will work for you as well :)

  title: "A Reappreciation of Redux: Why my team at PayPal removed Apollo Client and went back to Redux"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Keeping up with the JavaScript community can be one of the most difficult yet enjoyable parts of
    being a frontend developer. <br> <br>

    It is not easy to know what will truly deliver lasting value to your development as opposed
    to what is merely a passing fad or what will fail to live up to its hype.
    My team at PayPal has been excitedly using GraphQL in many of our new apps.
    We love the idea of a single endpoint providing frontend developers access to
    the great multitude of PayPal services.<br> <br>

    In our excitement for GraphQL, we also implemented Apollo Client and React Apollo into our app.
    After all, the boilerplate and heavy weight of Redux has been much maligned,
    and we saw and easy way to significantly reduce the amount of code we wrote,
    all the while utilizing the sleek new utility for state management that Apollo Client provided.<br> <br>

    However, we soon realized that we had made a mistake and pre-emptively jumped into Apollo Client.
    The fact of the matter is, Redux is much more than simply state management, and we had failed
    in our original estimation to fully appreciate what Redux gave our app that Apollo Client simply does not.
    <br> <br>

    This talk will explore why we initially were so excited about Apollo Client and why it was our first choice.
    It will then explain how Apollo Client fell short of our needs, and why Redux is a significantly
    better choice for most larger applications. Finally, it will hope to inspire a reappreciation for Redux.

  title: "Testing React Components and Coding with Confidence"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Testing should make us confident. Confident that our software does what we think it does,
    and that it will continue to do so as we pile up features. <br> <br>

    But testing UI components rarely breeds confidence. Instead, it often makes us feel angry and unproductive.
    Let's look the beast in the eye and talk about a set of tools that make testing React components
    as easy as writing them. We'll learn how to mock component props, state, Redux state, app context
    from wrapper components, as well as API responses, without copy pasting boilerplate from one test
    to another.

  title: "Behavioral Programming with React: request, wait and block"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Behavioral programming simplifies the task of dealing with underspecification and conflicting
    requirements by enabling the addition of software modules that can not only add to but also
    modify existing behaviors. <br> <br>

    In this talk I will describe how Behavioral Programming concepts can be applied to React.
    Specifically, I will showcase real-world examples and demonstrate how programming using this
    new paradigm can alleviate some of the issues that arise when programming with large teams.
    Moreover I will present a library that can be used to program what I call "behavioral components"
    using this new idiom.

  title: "Navigating the hype-driven world of frontend development without going crazy"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    The obsession to always move on to the latest and greatest, 
    and the fear of missing out while working with tooling that's 
    older than few months is currently dominating the dev world. <br> <br> 
    
    Most developers are focused on the wrong things and they're constantly 
    discussing things that don't matter in the long run.
    Instead of making our workday look like fun and games by inventing tasks 
    that seem challenging to us, we should shift the focus to providing value 
    for the end user. <br> <br> 
    
    When we start looking at things in a new way, the FOMO is drastically reduced. 
    In this talk, we're going to explore all the common pitfalls and provide
    practical solutions for solving this problem once and for all.

  title: "Making games and physics work with Reason & Reprocessing"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Reprocessing is a new library for Reason, a rather new programming language
    building on the OCaml + JavaScript ecosystems.
    It’s a lean wrapper around OpenGL and WebGL and allows truly cross-platform
    games to be written rather easily. <br> <br>
    Reason is great for a whole lot of things, but let me take you through a
    story of trying to write a 2D physics engine in just under 8 hours (Mistakes were made),
    what strongly typed languages don’t protect you off, and a vision of what
    you could build with Reason or Reprocessing. The universal future is coming,
    and Reason is orienting itself just right with projects like bsb-native.
