  title: "Let's manage our local state with GraphQL."
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Apollo has given us freedom and happiness when it comes to managing our data coming from
    the server but we still had to write code and sometimes a lot of it to manage our local state?<br> <br>
    Well, what if we managed it with queries too? Sounds too awesome right?<br> <br>
    Let's learn how to do this with apollo-link-state

  title: "How modern browser technologies can improve your website"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    During the talk I will explain what recent browser technologies have emerged and how you can apply this to make the
    experience of the user better. This won't mean that you need to drop support for older browsers, these improvements
    can be used to enhance the experience instead of replacing it.

  title: "A Reappreciation of Redux: Why my team at PayPal removed Apollo Client and went back to Redux"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Keeping up with the JavaScript community can be one of the most difficult yet enjoyable parts of 
    being a frontend developer. <br> <br>
    
    It is not easy to know what will truly deliver lasting value to your development as opposed 
    to what is merely a passing fad or what will fail to live up to its hype.
    My team at PayPal has been excitedly using GraphQL in many of our new apps. 
    We love the idea of a single endpoint providing frontend developers access to 
    the great multitude of PayPal services.<br> <br>
    
    In our excitement for GraphQL, we also implemented Apollo Client and React Apollo into our app. 
    After all, the boilerplate and heavy weight of Redux has been much maligned, 
    and we saw and easy way to significantly reduce the amount of code we wrote, 
    all the while utilizing the sleek new utility for state management that Apollo Client provided.<br> <br>
    
    However, we soon realized that we had made a mistake and pre-emptively jumped into Apollo Client. 
    The fact of the matter is, Redux is much more than simply state management, and we had failed 
    in our original estimation to fully appreciate what Redux gave our app that Apollo Client simply does not. 
    <br> <br>

    This talk will explore why we initially were so excited about Apollo Client and why it was our first choice. 
    It will then explain how Apollo Client fell short of our needs, and why Redux is a significantly 
    better choice for most larger applications. Finally, it will hope to inspire a reappreciation for Redux.

  title: "Testing React Components and Coding with Confidence"
  keynote: false
  extract: > 
    Testing should make us confident. Confident that our software does what we think it does, 
    and that it will continue to do so as we pile up features. <br> <br>
    
    But testing UI components rarely breeds confidence. Instead, it often makes us feel angry and unproductive. 
    Let's look the beast in the eye and talk about a set of tools that make testing React components 
    as easy as writing them. We'll learn how to mock component props, state, Redux state, app context 
    from wrapper components, as well as API responses, without copy pasting boilerplate from one test 
    to another.

  title: "Behavioral Programming with React: request, wait and block"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Behavioral programming simplifies the task of dealing with underspecification and conflicting
    requirements by enabling the addition of software modules that can not only add to but also
    modify existing behaviors. <br> <br>
      
    In this talk I will describe how Behavioral Programming concepts can be applied to React. 
    Specifically, I will showcase real-world examples and demonstrate how programming using this 
    new paradigm can alleviate some of the issues that arise when programming with large teams. 
    Moreover I will present a library that can be used to program what I call "behavioral components" 
    using this new idiom.

    In this talk, we’re going deep on forms in React. <br> <br>
    I’ll explore managing validation, error messages, and working with 3rd-party 
    inputs and introduce you to Formik, a tiny form helper that lets you do all 
    the fun stuff I just mentioned and more.

  title: "Making games and physics work with Reason & Reprocessing"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Reprocessing is a new library for Reason, a rather new programming language 
    building on the OCaml + JavaScript ecosystems. 
    It’s a lean wrapper around OpenGL and WebGL and allows truly cross-platform 
    games to be written rather easily. <br> <br>
    Reason is great for a whole lot of things, but let me take you through a 
    story of trying to write a 2D physics engine in just under 8 hours (Mistakes were made), 
    what strongly typed languages don’t protect you off, and a vision of what 
    you could build with Reason or Reprocessing. The universal future is coming, 
    and Reason is orienting itself just right with projects like bsb-native.
